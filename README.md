# Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Exercises

## Overview
These are the coding exercises from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I've gone through the whole course and finished all of them. All of the source codes are written in Octave, which is really like MATLAB but open source and free. Throughout the course, I have to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch, such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural network and recommendation.

## Setup
If you want to check it, please either downlaod [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). Once you have IDE installed, import one of the exercises to Octave or MATLAB, then you should be good to go.
